<h3>Give me your eyes</h3>

Give me your eyes.<br>
Let me place them on the spires <br>
Of the castle that contains my heart. <br>
<br> <br>
From there, your eyes can look <br>
At the fields surrounding this castle - <br>
Once a lush green pasture of ladybirds, dragonflies, and <br>
Sunflowers that tried to touch the sun. <br>
Where the blades of grass bent and prayed <br>
Under the morning fog’s gentle hug; <br>
Glistening with a with a light that betrayed<br>
The universe within their transparent dewdrop jewelry. <br>
<br> <br>
It may be hard to believe this yellow field was once full <br>
Of dewdrop microcosms with a million lives, <br>
For they were soaked up by the sands of time. <br>
The chlorophyll green grasses are now sunburnt, <br>
Stiff, straw yellow brittle sticks yearning <br>
To prostrate before the sun once more. <br>
Brown crickets drove away the ladybirds <br>
As they lost their diamond dewdrops <br>
Forcing the rainbows to marinate in a sepia hue. <br>
<br> <br>
The lush soil is now crusty and parched, <br>
Its moisture evaporated into clouds. <br>
Perhaps somewhere far away, the sky is crying <br>
And the dewdrops joined the ocean salt - <br>
Now denizens of Poseidon’s kingdom, its bricks <br>
Made of tears from countless fields like mine. <br>
<br> <br>
Give me your eyes so I can take them <br>
To the towers of the castle around my heart. <br>
From there, let me hold up your eyeballs, and in their gaze, <br>
Refract to a point focus, the afternoon sun’s rays <br>
Somewhere on this endless yellow field to ignite <br>
A fire to complete what the sun left half done. <br>
Let the eagles in my sky be fed with the crickets <br>
That jump to flee the fire’s searing heat. <br>
<br> <br>
Let the inferno lions of elemental fire <br>
Wear these licks of flame as their manes, <br>
Join forces with the tornado eagles, and <br>
Burn my yellow field to the ground. <br>
Release the blades of grass from their yearning, <br>
In a spiral descent into their fiery graves – <br>
Let them bend in a last prayer to the sun. <br>
<br> <br>
Let my yellow field turn charcoal black. <br>
Let the dormant seeds buried in the ashes <br>
Sprout green phoenix feathers that sway <br>
In the breeze that the sated eagles leave behind. <br>
Let them call out to ladybirds and dragonflies, <br>
And flirt with the clouds, once again. <br>
Let sunflowers bloom and reach for the sun, <br>
And daffodils puff, once again. <br>
Give me your eyes so my fields may burn, <br>
And be alive, once again. <br>
